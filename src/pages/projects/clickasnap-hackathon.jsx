      I participated in the <strong>Bournemouth University X ClickASnap Hackathon</strong> in March 2023 with a group of friends. We were given a week to create a new feature idea for the ClickASnap website.
      <br /><br />
      We created a reels feature, which would use an algorithm to suggest photos based on which photos the user has liked. This would also have allowed easy implementation into a mobile app. Part of our idea was also to introduce QR codes to images, as the platform is based on views, so shareability is key.
      <br /><br />
      We used <strong>Replit</strong> to create a demo web page, and so we could all seamlessly collaborate. We presented our work at the end of the week to ClickASnap and the university staff.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>We won the Teamwork award for this project.</strong>
